File processing in Perl

open(FP, "stuff.txt");

open(FP, "stuff.txt") || die("bye");

3 file modes:
	1. read - open(FP, "stuff.txt");
	2. write - open(FP, ">stuff.txt");
	3. append - open(FP, ">>stuff.txt");
	
Write to a file:
	print(FP "thing\n");
	
Read from a file:
	$x = <FP>;
	chomp($x); - to remove \n from end of read line
	
	
open(FP, "file.txt");

@data = <FP>; - creates a list
# $data[0] has first line of file
	
chomp(@data); - remove "\n" from entire list
	
close(FP);
